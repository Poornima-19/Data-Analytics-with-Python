In this VG Sales Analysis, we will conduct an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing information on video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. The dataset was generated by scraping data from vgchartz.com and includes various attributes such as game rankings, names, platforms, release years, genres, publishers, and sales figures across different regions.

Our primary objective is to uncover intriguing patterns, trends, and correlations in the data. We will be leveraging the power of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to conduct our analysis and create engaging visualizations.
